# EKS (Amazon `Elastic Kubernetes Service`)

## What is EKS

- EKS is a `managed container orchestration service` provided by AWS

- EKS simplifies the deployment, management and scaling of containerized applications using Kubernetes

- EKS is suitable for organizations and developers looking to leverage Kubernetes for container orchestration `without the complexity of managing the underlying infrastructure`

- EKS offers a reliable, scalable and secure environment for deploying and managing containerized applications in the AWS cloud.

## How does EKS works?

- `Create EKS cluster` using AWS Console or CLI (eksctl)

- `Launch Managed or Self Managed EC2 nodes` or deploy your workloads to AWS Fargate.

- When your cluster is ready, you can configure your favorite Kubernetes tools such as (`kubectl`) to communicate with your cluster.

- `Deploy and manage workloads on your EKS cluster the same way that you would with any other Kubernetes environment.` You can also view information about your workloads using AWS console.
